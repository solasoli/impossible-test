<blockquote>If your business is not on the Internet, your business will be out of business.</blockquote>
Alan Koh, the Principal Trainer at Impossible Marketing, could not agree more with the above quote from Bill Gates, as he believes that being online helps companies to increase visibility and reduce operating costs.

Alan is a former banker from Standard Chartered Bank that won multiple awards before he quit his job to pursue his entrepreneurship journey in 2009. He started 11 businesses in the next four years, but all of them failed and nearly wiped out all his savings. While reflecting on his experience, he realised all his previous 11 businesses were unsuccessful as he was unable to attract enough customers. That inspired him to build a business that can solve the issue.

In 2012, he started Impossible Marketing with the vision of providing affordable digital marketing services to help companies get targeted traffic, quality leads and sales online. The results were overwhelming, and the team started to grow. In 2013, he converted Impossible Marketing to a private limited company offering digital marketing services and training programs to companies and individual who wish to excel.

His story was recently featured in The Sunday Times:

<blockquote><b>Never depends on a single source of revenue.</b></blockquote>
Andy was from one of the pioneer teams in Groupon Singapore (now known as Fave). During his stay as a senior account manager from 2010 to 2014, he has achieved more than SGD $3million in sales. In 2015, he left Groupon to start his own e-commerce business. He brought in different products from China and sold them on e-commerce platforms such as Groupon, Q10, Carousell, Shopee and Buy 123. The business grew rapidly. In 2016, he set up a warehouse in China to cope with the rising demand. In 2017, he expanded his business to Taiwan.

Since his e-commerce entrepreneurship journey, Andy has sold more than SGD $1.5 million worth of products in Singapore alone.
